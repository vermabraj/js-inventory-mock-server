- Provide a remove and update button on every item.
- Remove will remove the item from dom and your json server database as well.
- Update will prompt an input box which will update the price of any item.

```
use window.prompt
 'const new_price = prompt( â€˜Enter new price`)'
```

- Provide two buttons on to for sorting both from high to low and vice versa (based on price).
- Also provide two buttons 'price > 4000" and 'Price <= 4000" for filtering.

#### Note:-

- Always store price as a number not string. Otherwise you may face difficulty while sorting and filtering.
- Sorting and filtering will be done using Json-Server only.

## Requirements

- API details( use `Fetch`)
- `url`: `http://localhost:3000/products`
- query params:
  <!-- sort by price in ascending order -->

  - `_sort=price&_order=asc`: this will sort the products by price in ascending order.
  <!-- sort by price in descending order -->

  - `_sort=price&_order=desc`: this will sort the products by price in descending order.
  <!-- filter the products price <=4000> -->
  - `price_lte=4000` - this will filter the products price <=4000
  - `price_gte=4001` - this will filter the products price >= 4001

- example `http://localhost:3000/products?_sort=price&_order=asc`

- By default when the user loads the page, the user should be shown all products

- You should use JSON server
- use useEffect to display the data on the UI
- db.json is given in the boilerplate with initial data
- Sample product given below

```
 {
     "id": "1667755893510Shoe 2",
     "name": "Shoe 2",
     "price": 1234,
     "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing",
     "delivery": "2022-11-06",
     "image": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/19090/pexels-photo.jpg?cs=srgb&dl=pexels-web-donut-19090.jpg&fm=jpg"
   },
```

#### Things to follow :-

```
 1. Product form input boxes will have IDs as "name", "price", "description", "delivery" & "image" respectively.
 2. Add Product button ID :- "add_product".
 3. Sort Low to High button ID :- "sort-low-to-high"
